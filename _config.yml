  A place for me to keep various data science project I've worked on. I continuosly update them, so they may change from time-to-time.  
  <br><br>
  Ctrl + click on any of the badges to launch a fully interactive binder instance for each project in a new tab. They may take a bit
  to launch if they haven't been ran in a while, so please be patient; ii might take a couple minutes. You can check out a static, non-interative version
  at the repository on Github
